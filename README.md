# Important NOTICE
I built this project using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It incorporates various features such as sliders, modules, and triggers. In my CSS, I utilized a wide range of techniques, including pseudo-classes, absolute positioning, display grid, display flex, media queries, and many other useful properties.
The most important aspect is that I harnessed the power of ES6 by using modules to manage useful documentation, allowing for easier manipulation later on. I also made use of forEach and innerHTML to dynamically update the content.

## The responsible person for the project ?
